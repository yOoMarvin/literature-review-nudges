\section{Methodology}

This literature review follows a systematic approach, that is well-tried in the discipline of information systems (\cite{webster_analyzing_2002}). Because of a limited time frame this review was done in limited scope which means that not all papers and studies of the subject are covered. Rather, this literature review targets a qualitative subset of literature and thereby tries to be as representative as possible. The focus lies on publications of academic journals. To get a qualitative representation of the current research a journal-wise analysis is preferable to a database-based analysis. The overall approach follows a known pattern in information systems literature reviews (\cite{alavi_review_1992}).
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identifying, reviewing and analyzing existing literature in the field of digital nudges. This includes empirical, as well as non-empirical studies
\item Identifying theoretical and methodological approaches used to understand the use of nudges in consumer choice. This also includes the type of choices and the designed choice architecture.
\item Identifying a research gap withing existing literature to guide future research.
\end{enumerate}

To facilitate this strategy, several variables are necessary to consider. Because the underlying multidisciplinary  of digital nudges it is was not feasible to analyze all articles. Digital nudging is a concept that spans across several fields of research. Those variables are set journal- and paper-wise. A graphic of the screen process is available in the appendix (\ref{fig:method}).

\subsection{Journal selection}
Journal-wise variables are the journal domain and its rating. As suggested in existing literature, it is reasonable to not only look within the field of information systems research, but also outside (\cite{webster_analyzing_2002}). It is reasonable to examine the academic journals with the most influence in the research domain. As already mentioned, nudging is a subject of several research streams. This includes research from the area of information systems, management, marketing, behavioral economics and psychology. Regarding research about information systems the \textit{AIS Basket of 8} provides a good source (\cite{alavi_review_1992}). This basket consists out of eight well respected journals in the domain. After the AIS scholarly basket, academic journals about management and marketing were recorded into the research process. Thereby, the journal list of the \textit{UT Dallas} was taken as a reference point. Duplicate journals from the lists of the AIS scholarly basket and the UT Dallas were eliminated and only analyzed ones. Overall the journal list of the UT Dallas contributes with twelve journals to the research pool. To gain further insights into the concept of nudges, academic journals from the domains of behavioral economics, decision making and psychology (with regards to human decision making) are included in the research process. The relevant publications are identified by the \textit{VHB} journal rating \textit{JOURQUAL3}\footnote{more information under \url{https://vhbonline.org/vhb4you/jourqual/vhb-jourqual-3/gesamtliste/}}. Journals with a rating of \textit{B} or better are taken into account for the research. To finalize the list of sources for the upcoming analysis, conference publication from the AIS pool with a VHB rating of \textit{B} or better were included, too. In total 36 journals were examined. A complete list of these journals can be found in the appendix. %TODO

\subsection{Paper selection}
Paper-wise, only articles with more than two pages and a publication date older than 2010 are concerned. This date is set because nudging is a rather new concept that was first introduced under this definition in 2009 (\cite{thaler_nudge:_2009}). To obtain relevant articles, a keyword based search is conducted. The major keywords in this search are \textit{nudg* AND digital}. All journals are searched by a full-text search. Because the term nudging is not always directly mentioned in the articles, additional keywords are added to the search query if the examined journal does not provide any necessary results with regards to they keyword \textit{nudg*}. Those additional keywords are \textit{decision, choice, consumer}. Overall 87 journal articles were found that mentioned the term nudge or matched the described keywords. To extract the most relevant sources, articles were excluded to based on several criteria. This concerns journal papers that only embody offline nudges. Such articles were excluded from the final article list, as well as articles that focus on the topic of persuasion and long-term behavior change. In the end 37 articles are evaluated in the final concept matrix. The complete list of articles is available in the appendix. %TODO

\subsection{Analysis approach}
To guide the analysis, the research takes several questions into account. The structure of those questions is based on prior literature research (\cite{alavi_review_1992}).
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the type of choice?
\item What is the research approach?
\item What major theories, concepts, heuristics and biases are used to study the effect of the evaluated nudge and how is the choice guided?
\item What part of the choice architecture is influenced?
\end{itemize}

Concerning the in-depth analysis, the extracted articles are coded in a concept matrix. To answer the underlying research questions, different categories of the relevant articles are inspected. Those categories are 
\begin{itemize}
\item General research information and metadata
\item Influence on choice architecture
\item Underlying concepts and theories
\end{itemize}

A complete version of the coding and concept matrix is available in the appendix. %TODO
