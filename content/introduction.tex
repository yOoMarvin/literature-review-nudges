\section{Introduction}
It is a typical Sunday afternoon. John is sitting on the couch, watching a match of his favorite soccer club on TV. On his lap, he is holding his tablet while browsing the internet. John is looking for a good travel deal for his upcoming trip to Bali. On a news site, a prominent and bright advertisement catches his attention: \textit{Booking.com - From cozy country homes to funky city apartments}. That is precisely what John is looking for. He clicks the link and finds himself on a website full of images of traveling people. Moreover, there is a search field, too. John enters his dream-destination, the travel time and clicks on \textit{search}. After some seconds a list of hotels shows up. The first one catches his eyes. A beautiful beach, a nice pool and cozy, big bedrooms. Perfect. He clicks on the details. However,  John is starting to become nervous. A bright, red piece of information is showing him that this room has been booked three times in the last twelve hours. Also, there are only seven rooms left! His heart beats faster. He needs to get that deal! John clicks on the reservation button. He has just been nudged\footnote{A screenshot of the web page can be found in the appendix on Figure \ref{fig:booking}}.

%In the last ten years, our lives became more and more digitized. We buy products in online shops, book our next trip and holidays on digital hotel platforms and even manage our finances with the help of our smartphones (\cite{schneider_digital_2018}). All those digital environments have one thing in common. Choices. All the time users are faced with choices they have to take,  even if people do not perceive it directly. There a lot of things digital (and also non-digital) environments that frame the whole choice process and therefore influence the decision-making through certain biases and heuristics (\cite{tversky_judgment_1974}). 

"What is chosen often depends upon how the choice is presented" (\cite[p.488]{johnson_beyond_2012}). This presentation describes the term of choice architecture, which should "alter people's behavior in a predictable way" (\cite[p.6]{thaler_nudge:_2009}). In the age of digital transformation, digital environments are powerful tools where the choice architecture can be controlled in detail and therefore provide opportunities to influence user behavior in several ways. This process is called \textit{digital nudging} (\cite{weinmann_digital_2016}).
Digital nudging and the design of online choice architecture have recently gained interest in different research areas. Because of the underlying complexity, it is significant to understand how such nudges influence the decision-making of the user and how the cognitive biases behind this process are working. Especially in consumer choices, there are good and bad patterns of nudging when it comes to an ethical point of view (\cite{sunstein_nudging_2015}). This paper presents a systematic literature review of the last ten years to get a better understanding of how digital nudges influence consumer choice.

The goals of this paper are two-folded. The primary aim is to provide an overview of different research streams within the topic of digital nudges. The paper focuses here on digital nudges in the area of consumer choice and their specific design elements. Literature in this domain shall be gathered, reviewed and analyzed. Different target groups, such as product designers, managers and user interface designers, can use this knowledge to implement nudges in digital applications more thoughtful and efficient. Furthermore, the correct use of nudges in combination with design elements can increase user experience, customer satisfaction and therefore conversion rates for digital products (\cite{conitzer_hide_2012}).
Secondary, a recommendation for future research is derived from the analysis to advance research in this particular subject. Because of its multidisciplinary nature, research on digital nudges may contribute to several scientific domains, such as information systems, psychology, and behavioral economics.
