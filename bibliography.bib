	abstract = {The sociotechnical paradigm legitimates our discipline and serves as core identity of IS. In this study, we want to focus on IS-induced human behavior by introducing a process model for nudging in IS. In behavioral economics, the concept of nudging has been proposed, which makes use of human cognitive processes and can direct people to an intended behavior. In computer science, the concept of persuasion has evolved with similar goals. Both concepts, nudging and persuasion, can contribute to IS research and may help to explain and steer user behavior in information systems. We aim for an integration of both concepts into one digital nudging process model, making it usable and accessible. We analyzed literature on nudging and persuasion and derived different steps, requirements, and nudging elements. The developed process model aims at enabling researchers and practitioners to design nudges in e.g. software systems but may also contribute to other areas like IT governance. Though the evaluation part of our study has not yet been completed, we present the current state of the process model enabling more research in this area.},

	abstract = {According to behavioral economists, a “nudge” is an attempt to steer individuals toward making desirable choices without affecting their range of choices. We draw on this concept, and design and examine nudges that exploit social influence’s effects to control individuals’ choices. Although recommendation agent research provides numerous insights into extending information systems and assisting end consumers, it lacks insights into extending enterprise information systems to assist organizations’ internal employees. We address this gap by demonstrating how enterprise recommendation agents (ERAs) and social nudges can be used to tackle a common challenge that enterprise information systems face. That is, we use an ERA to facilitate information (i.e., reports) retrieval in a business intelligence system. In addition, we use social nudges to steer users toward reusing specific recommended reports rather than choosing between recommended reports randomly. To test the effects of the ERA and the four social nudges, we conduct a within-subject lab experiment using 187 participants. We also conduct gaze analysis (“eye tracking”) to examine the impact of participants’ elaboration. The results of our logistic mixed-effects model show that the ERA and the proposed social nudges steer individuals toward certain choices. Specifically, the ERA steers users toward reusing certain reports. These theoretical findings also have high practical relevance and applicability: In an enterprise setting, the ERA allows employees to reuse existing resources (such as existing reports) more effectively across their organizations because employees can more easily find the reports they actually need. This, in turn, prevents the development of duplicate reports.},

In eight studies, comprising 11,508 participants making 2,423 donation decisions in both experimental settings and a largescale natural ﬁeld experiment, the authors investigate the effect of “choiceoption” defaults on the donation rate, average donation amount, and the resulting revenue. They ﬁnd (1) a “scale-back” effect, in which low defaults reduce average donation amounts; (2) a “lower-bar” effect, in which defaulting a low amount increases donation rate; and (3) a “defaultdistraction” effect, in which introducing any defaults reduces the effect of other cues, such as positive charity information. Contrary to the view that setting defaults will backﬁre, defaults increased revenue in the ﬁeld study. However, the ﬁndings suggest that defaults can sometimes be a “selfcanceling” intervention, with countervailing effects of default option magnitude on decisions and resulting in no net effect on revenue. The authors discuss the implications of the ﬁndings for research on fundraising speciﬁcally, for choice architecture and behavioral interventions more generally, and for the use of “nudges” in policy decisions.},

We model peer disclosure as the imposition of a negative externality on other people. Our model encompasses the beneﬁts of posting information, positive externalities in the form of recognition and entertainment beneﬁts due to others’ sharing of information, and heterogeneous privacy preferences. We ﬁnd that regulation of peer disclosure is necessary. We consider two candidate regulations, i.e., nudging and quotas. Nudging reduces user participation and privacy harm and sometimes improves social welfare. By contrast, imposing a quota often improves user participation, privacy protection, and social welfare. Adding a nudge on top of a quota does not bring additional beneﬁts. We show that any regulation that uniformly controls the disclosure of sensitive and nonsensitive information will not serve the triple objectives of reducing privacy harm, increasing social welfare, and increasing information contribution. We derive a necessary condition for solutions that can fulﬁll these three objectives. We also compare the incentives of the platform owner and social planner and draw related managerial and policy implications.},

In this paper, we empirically investigate online friends’ social inﬂuence in online book ratings. Our quasi-experimental research design exploits the temporal sequence of socialnetworking events and ratings and oﬀers a new method for identifying social inﬂuence while accounting for the homophily eﬀect. We ﬁnd that rating similarity between friends is signiﬁcantly higher after the formation of the friend relationship, indicating that with social-networking functions, online rating contributors are socially nudged when giving their ratings. Exploration of contingent factors suggests that social inﬂuence is stronger for older books and for users who have smaller networks, and that relatively more recent and extremely negative ratings cast more salient inﬂuence.},

The results of seven studies demonstrate that displaying healthy items to the left (vs. right) of unhealthy items enhances preference for the healthy options. In addition, consumption volume of a healthy item (visa`-vis an unhealthy item) is higher when it is placed to the left (vs. right) of the unhealthy item. We propose that a “healthy-left, unhealthy-right” (vs. healthy-right, unhealthy-left) lateral display pattern is congruent with consumers’ mental organization of food items varying in healthfulness, which enhances ease of processing and in turn enhances self-control, thereby leading to a relatively higher likelihood of choosing healthy options. While prior studies have examined the role of several factors in inﬂuencing choices between healthy and unhealthy options, the present research is the ﬁrst to demonstrate the effects of lateral display positions of healthy/unhealthy options on choice and healthful consumption. The ﬁndings of our research have important implications for designing retail food displays and restaurant menus as well as for conducting research studies involving healthy and unhealthy food displays.},

	abstract = {Consumers typically infer greater quantity from larger numbers. For instance, a 500 gram box of chocolates appears heavier than a .5 kilogram box. By expressing quantities in alternative units or attribute dimensions, one can represent an otherwise identical quantity in a more versus less discretized manner (e.g., a box containing 25 chocolates vs. a box weighing 500 grams). Seven experimental studies show that a difference between more discretized quantities (e.g., 25 vs. 50 chocolates) appears larger relative to a difference between less discretized quantities (e.g., 500 grams vs. 1,000 grams), above and beyond effects of number magnitude. More discretized quantity expressions enhance the consumers’ ability to discriminate between choice options and can also nudge consumers to more favorable choices. Because more discretized quantities are more evaluable, expressing a quantity in terms of a collection of elements particularly helps individuals who are less numerically proﬁcient. By identifying how discretization functions as a novel antecedent of evaluability and by distinguishing two different conceptualizations of numerosity (i.e., symbolic and perceptual numerosity), this article draws important connections between the numerical cognition literature and General Evaluability Theory.},

However, less is known about how to sustain the pursuit of a nonconscious goal, a reality that is reﬂected in the common ﬁnding that nonconscious goal pursuit typically persists for only one choice episode. This research investigates two factors that help sustain the pursuit of a nonconscious goal: increasing the level of goal activation prior to goal pursuit and limiting the extent of goal deactivation after a goal-consistent behavior. When one of these two factors is present, nonconscious goal pursuit is sustained, as evidenced by a longer sequence of goal-consistent choices. Five studies compare and contrast strategies for sustaining conscious and nonconscious goal pursuit and provide insight into how the goal system manages the pursuit of a nonconscious goal. In addition, the ﬁndings inform when a consumer is more or less likely to pursue opposing goals across sequential choices (e.g., being virtuous after being indulgent).},

Specifically, they argue that the diagnosticity of the number of reviews, relative to average product ratings, increases when average product ratings are negative or neutral (vs. positive) and when the level of review numbers in a choice set is low (vs. high). As a result, when consumers choose among the best options on one of the review attributes (average product ratings or the number of reviews), their preference shifts from the higher-rated option with fewer reviews toward the lower-rated option with more reviews. The authors demonstrate this preference shift in seven studies, elucidate the underlying process by which this occurs, and conclude with a discussion of the implications for retailers and brands.},

In addition to inﬂuencing overall experience, can ambient light luminance have unintended consequences in terms of inﬂuencing what diners order? The results of a ﬁeld study at multiple locations of a major restaurant chain and a series of lab studies robustly show that consumers tend to choose less healthy food options when ambient lighting is dim (vs. bright). Process evidence suggests that this phenomenon occurs because ambient light luminance inﬂuences mental alertness, which in turn inﬂuences food choices. While restaurant and grocery store managers can use these insights and their ambient light switches to nudge consumers toward targeted food choices, such as healthy or high-margin signature items, health-conscious consumers can opt for dining environments with bright ambient lighting.},

	abstract = {Facing purchase choice involving ambiguity in product quality, consumers behave in a boundedly rational manner. Consumers also exhibit varying degrees of predisposition toward a product. We present a simple model of boundedly rational choice under ambiguity. The model’s key feature is that it captures the interaction between predisposition and ambiguity. We build on the choice model to derive demand curves and the unique equilibrium market outcomes (regarding prices, proﬁts, and market shares) under duopolistic competition. In equilibrium, market shares are proportional to prices. In symmetric competition, higher equilibrium prices obtain when the ambiguity in product quality is high or when the customer base is partisan. For vertically diﬀerentiated products, the strategy of a higher-quality ﬁrm to marginally reduce ambiguity depends on the ambiguity level inherent in the product–market environment. The presence of informed customers may increase the equilibrium prices and proﬁts of both ﬁrms. An understanding of the predisposition–ambiguity interaction may improve the ﬁrm’s information and brand management strategy.},

Consumer advocates have proposed that disclosing how defaults are intended to inﬂuence choices could help protect consumers from being unknowingly manipulated. This research shows that consumers appreciate transparency, but disclosure does not make defaults less inﬂuential. Seven experiments demonstrate that disclosure alters how fair consumers perceive defaults to be but does not attenuate default effects because consumers do not understand how to counter the processes by which defaults bias their judgment. Given that defaults lead consumers to focus disproportionately on reasons to choose the default even with disclosure, debiasing default effects requires that consumers engage in a more balanced consideration of the default and its alternative. Encouraging people to articulate their preferences for the default or its alternative, as in a forced choice, shifts the focus away from the default and reduces default effects.},

However, the nature of screens and the vast amount of information available online make individuals particularly prone to deficient decisions. Digital nudging is an approach based on insights from behavioral economics that applies user interface (UI) design elements to affect the choices of users in digital environments. UI design elements include graphic design, specific content, wording or small features. To date, little is known about the psychological mechanisms that underlie digital nudging. To address this research gap, we conducted a systematic literature review and provide a comprehensive overview of relevant psychological effects and exemplary nudges in the physical and digital sphere. These insights serve as a valuable basis for researchers and practitioners that aim to study or design information systems and interventions that assist user decision making on screens.},

Whereas previous research on this “MPG illusion” has focused on people’s biased choices of upgrading vehicle models, it has not examined a more common situation, namely, estimating a given vehicle’s fuel efﬁciency based on the average of two efﬁciency values (e.g., in the city and on highways). In such situations, we ﬁnd an additional bias in people’s judgment and choice, the average fuel-efﬁciency fallacy, in which people falsely believe that the combined fuel efﬁciency (e.g., of city and highway MPG) is a simple—instead of a harmonic—mean of the two values. Owing to the curvilinear relationship between fuel efﬁciency and fuel consumption, the combined fuel-efﬁciency value would always be lower than the simple average, resulting in consistent overestimations of the actual fuel efﬁciency. In a series of studies, we demonstrate how this fallacy of overestimating combined fuel efﬁciency leads to suboptimal choices between vehicles. In addition, we ﬁnd that the solution prescribed for the MPG illusion—using gallons per 100 miles—does reduce, but not eliminate, the average fuel-efﬁciency fallacy, and that comprehension of the gallons per 100 miles measure is a precursory condition for this nudge to have any effect.

We also observed that only 7\% of the studies applied power analysis, 2\% used guidelines aiming to improve the quality of reporting, no study in our database was preregistered, and the used intervention nomenclatures were non-exhaustive and often have overlapping categories. Building on our current observations and proposed solutions from other ﬁelds, we provide directly applicable recommendations for future research to support the evidence accumulation on why and when nudges work.

In the second experiment, an automatic donation mechanism is provided that allows subjects to self-select into an opt-out framing; when combined with incentive-neutral, social-norm supporting activities (cheap talk and voting), automatic donations sustain increased contributions over a tenmonth study period to an HIV/AIDS-related charity. In the third experiment, we study the extent to which the mention of HIV/AIDS in the charity’s informational material impacts the emotions and donations of potential donors. In this case the connection to HIV/AIDS does not elicit stigma, but we do ﬁnd that changes in mood from exposure to the charity’s informational material predict increased donations, and that donors experience an improved mood from donating.},

This study empirically tests the effectiveness of two institutional nudges on the ECE in a ﬁeld experiment at a bar. Focusing on craft beer sales, we manipulate the number of options on the menu and use institutional nudges (a control menu, a menu with a special prominently displayed, and a menu with Beer Advocate scores). In the ﬁeld experiment, the ECE was alive and well using the control menu, but the effect reversed itself when the menu included Beer Advocate scores.

This is referred to as the standard mode. In the penalty mode, the participant must give up an explicit amount of money in order to choose the smaller and sooner option (e.g., “€75 in 61 days vs. €55 today with a penalty of €20”). This is the explicit mode. We ﬁnd that estimates of individual discount rates are lower in the explicit mode than in the standard mode. This result suggests that even very simple information about the amount of money one must surrender for choosing the earlier option increases delayed consumption.

	abstract = {When making purchase decisions, consumers want objective product specifications and seek direct product comparison. The present research demonstrates that consumers can make better decisions (i.e., choose what yields a better consumption experience) if objective specifications are removed and direct comparison is inhibited than if not, and this is true even if consumers cannot experience the target products themselves at the time of choice (such as in online shopping). The reason is that consumption is largely subjective and non-comparative, and decisions based on subjective and non-comparative information are often more compatible with consumption. In general discussion, we explore the boundary conditions of our findings and the implications of this research for a new way of marketing that emphasizes subjectivity over objectivity and noncomparison over comparison.},

While self-control can inhibit individuals from consuming impulsively, self-image motives can induce impulsive consumption. Based on recent neuroscientiﬁc ﬁndings about ‘wanting’–‘liking’ dissociations, the paper presents the cue-triggered ‘wanting’ mechanism as one potential explanation for the occurrence of such impulsive consumption. Utilizing the knowledge of this mechanism and acknowledging both aspects of reﬂexive thought, the paper expands on three libertarian paternalistic means to foster an ethical way of impulsive consumption: strengthening willpower, reducing impulsive desires to consume, and guiding impulsive behavior in ethical directions by making salient certain self-images that favor ethical consumption.},

	abstract = {Bonus-malus taxes appear to have been successful in encouraging people to change to less polluting travel options in France (e.g. the tax on large and small engined cars). We hypothesize that they have three possible effects on consumer behaviour. The positive effects are: (1) a price effect (the less polluting option is subsidized and the polluting option is taxed); and (2) a social norm effect (the less polluting option is classiﬁed as pro-social and the polluting option as antisocial). The negative effect (3) is that they may decrease intrinsic motivation (crowding out). We provide an initial test of this tripartite model using survey data on students given a choice between taking the plane or the train between Toulouse to Paris. The ﬁrst study shows that imposing a hypothetical bonus-malus tax has both a price effect (relative to a control condition where only the norm justifying the tax is presented) and a norm effect (relative to a control condition in which only the corresponding price difference is presented without mention of the tax). The second study presents a set of choices where the environmental norms and price differences are held constant, but the size of the contribution of the bonus-malus tax to the ﬁnal price of each option is varied. This study conﬁrms our prediction that a larger bonus-malus subsidy/tax reduces propensity to choose the less polluting option (i.e. the train). As the positive effects outweigh the negative effects in most of the choices studied, we conclude that bonus-malus taxes constitute a promising policy instrument.},

Estimates show that the CARD Act disclosures were effective in inducing households to increase the amounts of credit card debt paid off each month, with the strongest effects seen in the proportion of households who pay off balances in full each month. Among households who continue to carry credit card debt, there is minimal evidence of repayment behavior changes due to CARD.

However, being often very subtle and covert, nudges are also criticized as unethical. By not being transparent about the intention to inﬂuence individual choice they might be perceived as limiting freedom of autonomous actions and decisions. So far, empirical research on this issue is scarce. In this study, we investigate whether nudges can be made transparent without limiting their eﬀectiveness. For this purpose we conduct a laboratory experiment where we nudge contributions to carbon emission reduction by introducing a default value. We test how diﬀerent types of transparency (i.e. knowledge of the potential inﬂuence of the default, its purpose, or both) inﬂuence the eﬀect of the default. Our ﬁndings demonstrate that the default increases contributions, and information on the potential inﬂuence, its purpose, or both combined do not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the default eﬀect. Furthermore, we do not ﬁnd evidence that psychological reactance interacts with the inﬂuence of transparency. Findings support the policy-relevant claim that nudges (in the form of defaults) can be transparent and yet eﬀective.},

What has been missing from debates on nudging is a systematic consideration of the environments in which they are embedded. We argue that a detailed examination of the wider environment in which the policy issue is situated is essential for designing, implementing, and evaluating policy-making tools, nudge-like or otherwise. Successful policy making requires a good ﬁt between intervention and the environment, otherwise we risk miscasting policy issues and designing futile interventions. Using real-world cases, we characterize the role of the environment in diﬀerent policy problems and present a basic taxonomy for policy makers to identify critical factors in the environment beyond the conﬁnes of the choice architecture.},

There is, however, increasing evidence to suggest that ‘changing contexts’ by inﬂuencing the environments within which people act (in largely automatic ways) can have important effects on behaviour. We present a mnemonic, MINDSPACE, which gathers up the nine most robust effects that inﬂuence our behaviour in mostly automatic (rather than deliberate) ways.

At the public level, providing information about why and how to choose a healthy diet has been the typical approach to encouraging behavioral change. Information can also inﬂuence food producers and marketers to develop and promote more healthful products, creating an environment in which it is easier for consumers to make healthier dietary choices. Nevertheless, information may not always be effective in improving food choices. One explanation is that nutrition information is complex and difﬁcult to convey in a clear, actionable manner. Also, knowledge, while necessary, may not be sufﬁcient to motivate behavior change. Even when consumers understand nutrition information, competing preferences for tastier, less expensive, or more convenient foods may lead them to make other choices. Findings from psychology, marketing, and behavioral economics research suggest approaches that may enhance the effectiveness of informational approaches and complement informational efforts. More research is needed to further develop these strategies and evaluate their effectiveness. Published 2015. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.},

As a result, online platforms started offering new user identity verification mechanisms including online verification. However, convincing users to verify online represents a challenge as benefits must be carefully balanced with resulting risks. We combine Toulmin’s model of argumentation with Regulatory Focus Theory to develop communication arguments to nudge users into online verification. Two argument types consisting of both claim and claim-supporting data are employed: a promotion-focus argument conveying convenience and a prevention-focus argument aiming to reduce privacy concerns. In a controlled experiment, we find that both claims significantly increase online verification conversion rate if supported by data. The effect of a prevention-focus claim is stronger than that of a promotion-focus claim. However, if a prevention-focus claim is not supported by data, it actually decreases online verification rate compared to if no claim is shown.},

Either customers could choose a channel that is more expensive for the company or they inform themselves in one channel but switch to a competitor for the final purchase. We aim to influence channel choice by using the recently proposed IS concept of digital nudging. In particular, we leverage the nudges of social norms and perceived risk in the online channel. In addition to this concept, we propose that the individual context of the user, like gender or personality, has to be incorporated as a moderator by designing customer specific (i.e. adaptive) nudges. To test these hypotheses, we outline an experiment design for a lab experiment and show how multi-channel choices can be influenced with design interventions in the form of nudges. As previous studies have only tested static nudges, we contribute to existing research by enhancing the nudge theory to adaptively consider user characteristics. Moreover, we apply the nudge theory to the new context of multi-channel choices. Finally, we provide guidance for practitioners on designing their own online channels.},

However, technological innovations which provide a more sustainable way of living, for instance electric cars, are not always welcomed with open arms by consumers but often resisted at the beginning. As such, human resistance behavior can be explained as an interplay of different personality traits that favour the status quo. In this study, a decision support system design is introduced which bases on the concept of digital nudging that addresses innovation resistance on an individual’s cognitive level by de-biasing innovation trial decision-making. An experimental pre-study is conducted to test the influence of different DSS modifications on the selection of electric cars in an online rental car booking scenario. First results show that DSS which set sustainable innovations as default option have a significantly positive effect on their trial probability while priming consumers towards electric car trial has no significant effect.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the suitability of online social media (OSM) as a means of influencing the public’s decision-making process regarding vaccinations, specifically a vaccination to protect girls against HPV, a virus associated with cervical cancer. Using the Health Belief Model (HBM), we carry out an experimental study of the influence of cues to action, and of other’s opinions, via OSM, on the parents’ attitude towards the vaccine and on their intention to vaccinate. Analyses revealed no effect of our experimental manipulations of the different cues to action on their vaccination decision. However, using an exploratory novel network analysis, we find that the HBM does not adequately account for influence via OSM. Specifically we show that vaccination decisions are not taken in social isolation, a fact thus far ignored by various forms of the HBM. These tentative findings may guide alternative approaches for influencing the public’s decision-making process. Implications for studies assessing the use of online channels for health communication are discussed.},

	abstract = {Is nudging unethical? Is choice architecture a problem for a free society? This essay defends seven propositions: (1) It is pointless to object to choice architecture or nudging as such. Choice architecture  cannot be avoided.  Nature itself nudges; so does the weather; so do customs and traditions; so do spontaneous orders and invisible hands. The private sector inevitably nudges, as does the government. It is reasonable to worry about nudges by government and to object to particular nudges, but not to nudging in general. (2) In this context, ethical abstractions (for example, about autonomy, dignity, manipulation, and democratic self-government) can create serious confusion. To make progress, those abstractions must be brought into contact with concrete practices. Nudging and choice architecture take highly diverse forms, and the force of an ethical objection depends on the specific form. (3) If welfare is our guide, much nudging is actually required on ethical grounds, even if it comes from government. (4) If autonomy is our guide, much nudging is also required on ethical grounds, in part because some nudges actually promote autonomy, in part because some nudges enable people to devote their limited time and attention to their most important concerns. (5) Choice architecture should not, and need not, compromise either dignity or self-government, but it is important to see that imaginable forms could do both. It follows that when they come from government, choice architecture and nudges should not be immune from a burden of justification, which they might not be able to overcome. (6) Some nudges are objectionable because the choice architect has illicit ends. When the ends are legitimate, and when nudges are fully transparent and subject to public scrutiny, a convincing ethical objection is less likely to be available. (7) There is ample room for ethical objections in the case of well-motivated but manipulative interventions, certainly if people have not consented to them; such nudges can undermine autonomy and dignity. It follows that both the concept and the practice of manipulation deserve careful attention. The concept of manipulation has a core and a periphery; some interventions fit within the core, others within the periphery, and others outside of both.},
